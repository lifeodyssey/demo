      "reviewContent": "I have tried reading several books on system design but this is by far the best book on the topic if you are starting from scratch and have limited time. I could easily finish the whole book in a week with about 2 hours per day and I went over several chapters twice. The book is organized very sensibly and has just the right level of detail for interview purposes.\nMy only suggestion would be to get the book edited by a good editor for the next version as the current version has some very obvious grammatical and vocabulary errors.",
